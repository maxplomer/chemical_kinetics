#Chemical Kinetics Package ##(Chemkin programmed in Matlab)

Max Plomer created the Clean Fuel Chemical Kinetics software package in Matlab it helps to simplify the process of reading fuel mechanisms and creating the necessary functions to model reactors, such as calculating thermodynamic data and reaction  rates.

The Clean Fuel Chemical Kinetics code represents many of the core capabilities of the Chemkin and Cantera chemical kinetics packages. The purpose of the Matlab code was to avoid Chemkin fees and also to make the code much easier to understand by using a high-level programming language. A GNU Octave-Fortran Hybrid version was created that is still very easy to understand and avoids both Chemkin and Matlab fees.
