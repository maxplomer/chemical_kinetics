this backup is actually faster now

kfarray using vector math is working but was slower now faster, need to try **global A B E

and ***combine lines eliminate kf variable ***only use kfarray, to see if makes it faster


check out how much getABE uses vs global ABE on matlabprofiler/optimizer

maybe vectorize KC overall (extra work but faster because vectorized) (look at original code), or try the multiply-log thing again

vectorize 3rd body (3rd body will complicate eliminating kf variable, if there is 3rd body can write kfarray(1)=kfarray(1)*(sumY+Y(1)*-1))
